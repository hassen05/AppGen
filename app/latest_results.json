        "Hey, User Researcher here üëãüèª\n\nI could be wrong, but since you said everyone ‚Äúacknowledges‚Äù the problem, I‚Äôm assuming that you‚Äôre asking them IF x and y are a pain point for them, which is leading them to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù.\n\nAre you?\n\nIf this is the case, you need to stop doing this.\n\nInstead, ask them what they did in the past to solve the problem you are trying to solve.\n\nThen, dig deeper into the reasons why this is a problem for them, and why what they did helped them.\n\nThen, compare what they said with your solution. \n\nAvoid introducing solutions this early on, unless you‚Äôve built a solution already based on insights from previous research.",

      "selftext": "For years I couldn't figure out why it was so hard for me to go on vacation or take a break and \"forget about my startup\".  \n\nI would try, but every time I did I wound up being even more anxious than when I started.  I'd get 2 days into a week-long vacation, and I'd be sitting by the pool trying to wind down, but all my brain could do was think about what I had to do with my startup.\n\nSo a couple of years ago, I tried something different - I looked for a challenge that I could obsess over that was WAY bigger than my startup - and that's when it finally clicked.\n\nI'm an avid hobbyist carpenter, so I decided to design and build a new house entirely on my own.  I would learn everything from 3D modeling to create it to all of the trades necessary to build it.  I made this thing so overwhelming that I had no choice but to consume my brain.\n\n(BTW you can learn literally anything on YouTube!)\n\nNow, truth be told, I wasn't able to build every single aspect myself since there were certain things (like laying foundation or structural steel) the I wasn't looking to take chances with.  But I've designed every. single. aspect of this house in full 3D (Sketchup, Enscape, Vray) down to the size of the drawer slide in the basement bathroom.  I've built every kitchen cabinet, vanity, closet - you name it.  \n\nBut this isn't me talking about my carpentry skills; it's about talking about what it DID for me.  \n\nIt completely changed my focus.  Not in a way where it hurt my startup, but in a way it HELPED my startup (and me personally, which I think should count for something).\n\nI needed something that could compete with those anxious thoughts at 2am where I would normally be trying to solve my startup problems that frankly never got solved at 2am.  Instead my mind was consumed by SOLVABLE problems like how to best join two parts of a cabinet.  I had no idea how badly my mind needed to work on things that had a definitive start and end (this isn't a small point, many of us having timelines that are years, decades).\n\nI'm curious if anyone here has had a similar experience of how they've found a challenging counterbalance to their startup.  Yes, I'm also a father of two, so I'm well aware of how family fits here, I'm talking about outside of that.\n\n(I will not promote)",

This did not help as my mind was still in work 24/7 I just worked on different part of it with same obsessive passion.\n\nYear and a half ago my old game of choice, quake 2, got remastered and the community of old players resurfaced. This gave me option and push to try something I always wanted to do, make new maps.\n\nI found discord and people that helped me start, and there I was, obsessed by my new old passion. It helped me relax, moved my thoughts away from startup and business meetings.\n\nDid it help both? Well I for sure am better as I refocused to me, family and what I love. For the startup I think it also gave space to others to step where my obsession moved away.\n\nHope we both get the best out of this life.\nThanks for sharing OP.",

        "Keep the invitations to people that physically show up to meetups or participate in other events. And have channels dedicated to people at similar stages. Don‚Äôt make the good ones run away after¬†drowning in messages from those just starting out and begging for introductions to the investors.¬†",
        "Yes. I run StartupSauce, a private slack community for advanced SaaS founders based outside Silicon Valley. \n\nSome advice:\n\n1 - Screen people before they are allowed to join. \n\nWe only allow founders and CEOs of SaaS businesses with $5k MRR or more to join. \n\nWe don‚Äôt take idea stage folks. We don‚Äôt take non-founders. We don‚Äôt accept people who run non-SaaS businesses. \n\nThis keeps the group relevant and ensures discussion is on point. It also filters out a lot of bad advice. \n\n2 - Have a regular ritual that brings people together. \n\nWe organise bi-weekly mastermind calls where founders can discuss problems and give each other advice. Technically they could just do this via the slack group - but there‚Äôs something a lot more human about a video call. Many of our members rarely post, but engage a lot on these calls. We also generally see a flurry of activity after these calls as it brings people back to our slack group and they catch up on all the other messages.\n\n3 - Don‚Äôt poke people for fake engagement \n\nThis was a crucial lesson for us. The conventional wisdom is to push people constantly to engage on slack. But our members are founders, they‚Äôre busy building their company and don‚Äôt want to sift through a thousand irrelevant messages to find one gold nugget. \n\nSo we focus on more signal, less noise. If we find something genuinely great, we‚Äôll post it. If someone asks for help, we‚Äôll offer resources and intros and tag other members with relevant experience. But we don‚Äôt just post shit for the sake of it - that‚Äôs just an annoying distraction for our members and we want to focus on quality. \n\n4 - Make sure there is a place to celebrate wins\n\nAs entrepreneurs, we spend a lot of time fighting fires and dealing with problems, so it‚Äôs nice to actually take some time out to be proud of what we built. \n\nAt StartupSauce we do this two ways. First we have a #wins channel where folks can post anything they consider a win. This isn‚Äôt necessary revenue - we‚Äôve had people post about finally finding that awesome developer they‚Äôve been trying to hire for months; or getting a kickass testimonial from a happy customer, to being able to fire their last consulting client and go all-in on their bootstrapped software business. These posts usually get a LOT of positive encouragement from other founders - and it feels really damn good to have a whole slack community of other founders cheering for you. \n\nThe other way? We have an unofficial tradition that when a member reaches $1m ARE we send them a gift - usually a bottle of wine or whiskey or something. I even bought some really fancy sparkling wine for a founder who didn‚Äôt drink. This is a huge milestone and it‚Äôs important to celebrate it. About 30% of our members are at $1m ARR or beyond so we‚Äôve actually had to buy a lot of gifts üòÇ. \n\n5 - Make sure there are some formal learning opportunities\n\nWe do workshops once a month. Usually they are member-led. Sometimes we record them, but sometimes - if the subject matter is really sensitive - we don‚Äôt. We have a big library of previous workshops that new members can watch. Everything from how to actually run FB ads for SaaS to building competitor comparison pages for SEO to selling your business and managing stress and burnout as a founder. \n\nWe ALSO require all our members to - at some stage - run a workshop or be on a panel discussion. So there is a formal mechanism for each member to share their knowledge with the community. This is super valuable, because it‚Äôs very rare that an earlier stage founder can get easy access to insights from so many other founders who are a few steps ahead. \n\nThere‚Äôs a LOT more to this, happy to discuss further privately if you want to DM me. \n\nWe made a bunch of mistakes too, like not having a content layer when we started, so I eventually bit the bullet and started a podcast where I interview 7 figure SaaS founders - but that wasn‚Äôt until several years into running the community.",
        "We ran a 650 member Discord for startup founders and execs (2018-2022). It was great for support (early on) and off-platform meetups, but there were key challenges with engagement and scaling trust once the group got big.\n\n*Early Decisions (and challenges):*\n\n* Vetting\n* Guardrails\n* Legal risks\n* Discord vs Slack\n\n*What worked well:*\n\n* Off platform events - A lot of members hosted events - basketball, coffee meetups, co-working, etc. That created real bonds that carried back online.\n* Promo sharing - Discount codes for tools (Docusign, Workspace, Domain sites, etc.) were a hit and created a karma effect.\n* Office & equipment sharing - Members would lend short-term access to things like office desks, 3D printers, camera gear, etc. Office space they charged way lower than commercial options and for gear they usually just charged for things they used like filaments (for 3D printing). One cooler example: a few members went in together on a professional embroidery machine to make custom marketing hats and shirts. They broke even compared to getting them done professionally. Others in the group could use it too. All they had to do was bring their own thread and chip in a small donation.\n\n*What didn't work:*\n\n* Heavy mod dependence - For the first 9 months, the group required active mods to seed conversations, follow-ups, and maintain engagement. It helped that one mod was a semi-well known entrepreneur with multiple exits, so people wanted to hear what he had to say and give feedback.\n* Too many channels - We created too many which resulted in empty channels. This made people think the entire server was a ghost town. We trimmed them down to just a few core ones and only added new ones when there was consistent demand. I'd suggest start with like 3-5 channels.\n* Group got too big (after 100) - Once we crossed 100 members, engagement dropped noticeably. People shared less because they didn't feel safe sharing with so many newer faces. Over time, small cliques formed and it started to feel like high school all over again.\n* Member expectations - These communities thrive when new members show up ready to contribute. It signals to others that there's mutual value. But in reality, we found most people wanted to consume rather than contribute. Many wanted to feel like part of a community, but without actually engaging. By the end, over 92% of members were lurkers (we had bots tracking user activity). While they logged in regularly, they didn't meaningfully participate or add value to the group.",
        "I run our Slack community of founders at [Startups.com](http://Startups.com) that currently has 1,300+ members (not all active). The biggest thing is to make sure your channels are organized (with proper permissions) in a sensible fashion and you have people dedicated to getting the flywheel spinning. In other words, nobody likes being part of a Slack where nobody talks (too much talking is a whole other thing). I find that founders on Slack act differently than discord users. So, listen to your audience and keep adjusting until you find your culture.",
        "From the other side ‚Äî each of my VCs has a group, and I‚Äôm in three different Techstars groups. There are thousands of founders between them, but fewer than 10 founder posts total each month. Most of the posts are just people sharing their LinkedIn content asking for likes and shares. These rarely get any engagement in Slack, but a lot of founders engage with the actual LinkedIn post ‚Äî so people are reading.\n\nI‚Äôm also in a local startup studio group, which is the most active. I think it‚Äôs the most active bc they have someone on staff who always posts in there forcing engagement.\n\nThe most active Slack groups I‚Äôm in are highly focused ‚Äî like GTM for [X eg Heath tech SaaS] or JS devs. They have way fewer people, but dozens of posts every day.\n\nI think the problem with general startup groups is that, yeah, we‚Äôre all founders ‚Äî but that‚Äôs where the similarities end. We‚Äôre building totally different companies, at different stages, and we‚Äôre all overworked. The advice ends up being general, not pointed like in niche GTM or dev groups. I think segmenting founders into verticals could help like marketplaces, health tech, etc. \n\nThis would give me a specific place to post a specific question and I would get a response from someone else doing that exact thing‚Ä¶. Kinda like subreddits but more private."

      "selftext": "There‚Äôs this false sense of stability that creeps in when things are going well. Clients are happy, work is flowing, and there‚Äôs always that one person on your team who just... gets it. They manage the chaos. They catch the things you miss. They‚Äôre your safety net, even if you don‚Äôt realize it.\n\nI had that person.\n\nWe used to joke that they had the whole agency mapped out in their head. Timelines, deliverables, tricky clients, feedback loops-they managed it all. I could sleep easy knowing they were on top of things. It felt like we were finally at that stage where things were smooth. Predictable, even.\n\nI remember finishing a Friday knowing everything was handled. That kind of peace in business is rare-and addictive.\n\nThen one morning, I got a message that knocked the wind out of me: \"Hey, can we chat for five minutes?\"\n\nThat five-minute chat changed everything.\n\nThey were leaving. No drama, no issues. Just moving on to something that made sense for them. But for me, it felt like a giant hole just opened up under our feet.\n\nThe days that followed were rough. The kind of rough you only understand when you‚Äôve built a business too tightly around specific people instead of strong systems. Tasks were missed. Clients followed up asking things I didn‚Äôt have answers to. Team members were unsure who was handling what. Everything felt... fragile.\n\nI realized, painfully, that we had built a business on memory, not method. Talent, not structure. And I‚Äôm not knocking talent. I just finally saw how risky it is when it‚Äôs the only thing holding things together.\n\nSo I did what most of us avoid until we‚Äôre forced to. I paused, and rebuilt.\n\nIt started small. A single Notion page. One checklist. Then another. I sat down with the team and said, ‚ÄúIf you do something more than once, we need it documented.‚Äù\n\nWe didn‚Äôt aim for perfection. Just clarity.\n\nThere was some hesitation at first. No one wants to stop and write things down when work is piling up. But a few weeks in, it clicked. We were moving faster. Fewer questions, fewer dropped balls. Everyone could see the difference.\n\nWe created a living playbook. No bloated manuals. No outdated PDFs. Real steps, written by the people who actually do the work. Every week, we‚Äôd update it. Improve it. Turn chaos into clarity.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt glamorous. But over time, it changed everything.\n\nNow, when someone joins the team, they get the keys to our system. They don‚Äôt guess. They follow. And they grow. If someone needs time off or moves on, the work doesn‚Äôt stop. The process doesn‚Äôt break.\n\nNotion, surprisingly, became the backbone of our business. A simple tool we underestimated turned into the foundation for consistency and growth.\n\nIf we were to hire someone new today, what used to take three weeks of handholding would now take just a few days. They‚Äôd step in, follow the process, and the system would do most of the heavy lifting. That‚Äôs how I know this is finally working.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing I wish someone had told me sooner:\n\nIf your business can‚Äôt run without one specific person, it‚Äôs not a business. It‚Äôs a dependency.\n\nProcesses aren‚Äôt the enemy of creativity. They protect it. They free your team to focus on better work, not just trying to remember what the next step is.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre running a service business, I‚Äôd challenge you to ask yourself:\n\n* What happens if your most reliable person takes two weeks off tomorrow?\n* Would the rest of your team know what to do?\n* Would your clients notice a difference?\n\nIf that question makes you uncomfortable, good. That‚Äôs where the work starts.\n\nStart with one thing. One recurring task. Write it down. Make it better each time. Tools like Notion or even a shared doc can take you a long way. Just don‚Äôt wait for the panic moment to make the shift.\n\nWe‚Äôre still improving. Still figuring things out. But we‚Äôre no longer scared of growing. And that feels like real progress.\n\nIf you‚Äôve been through a similar moment or are in the middle of one, I‚Äôd love to hear how you approached it. What worked, what didn‚Äôt, what you learned along the way.\n\nAnd if you haven‚Äôt hit that wall yet, maybe this story helps you avoid it.\n\nIf you're thinking about building your own SOP system and don‚Äôt know where to start, feel free to reach out. Always happy to help someone get unstuck.\n\n**A Simple SOP Template You Can Steal and Use Today:**\n\n**Title:** \\[Name of the task or process\\]\n\n**Purpose:** Briefly explain why this SOP exists and what outcome it supports.\n\n**Frequency:** How often is this task done (daily, weekly, monthly, ad hoc)?\n\n**Responsible:** Who is in charge of executing it?\n\n**Tools Needed:** List any apps, platforms, or tools required\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Step one (what exactly needs to be done)\n2. Step two (details and specific instructions)\n3. Step three (add context or edge cases if necessary)\n\n**Checklist (Optional):**\n\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to start with everything. Just start with what‚Äôs repeating and painful. That‚Äôs usually the best place to begin.\n\n  \nHope this helped you :)",

Massive ethics debate erupts.\n\nGood-enough content becomes free. Distribution, speed, and originality are king.\n\nMVPs need to feel complete on day one. If it works, it‚Äôll be cloned in 15 minutes.\n\n‚ÄúWhat software do you use?‚Äù becomes ‚ÄúWhat agents run your life?‚Äù\n\nGoldman Sachs replaces 25% of analysts with AI. Other firms follow.\n\nA startup will fail because a dominant agent misinterprets its product.\n\nThe new MVP = a prompt, a workflow, and a landing page.\n\nHiring an agent becomes the default for repetitive work.\n\nSMBs will be valued based on how easy they are to automate.\n\nNations enforce ‚Äúdigital protectionism‚Äù‚Äîblocking foreign agents.\n\nJailbroken GPT-9s hit the black market‚Äî$50k for unrestricted models.\n\nA new distribution hack emerges: get inside agent workflows.\n\nAI diagnoses 97% of conditions via smartphone pics; average doctors hit 62%.\n\nA small town becomes fully agent-run.

        "As a ChatGPT user, I&#x27;m weirdly happy that it&#x27;s not available there yet. I already have to make a conscious choice between<p>- 4o (can search the web, use Canvas, evaluate Python server-side, generate images, but has no chain of thought)<p>- o3-mini (web search, CoT, canvas, but no image generation)<p>- o1 (CoT, maybe better than o3, but no canvas or web search and also no images)<p>- Deep Research (very powerful, but I have only 10 attempts per month, so I end up using roughly zero)<p>- 4.5 (better in creative writing, and probably warmer sound thanks to being vinyl based and using analog tube amplifiers, but slower and request limited, and I don&#x27;t even know which of the other features it supports)<p>- 4o &quot;with scheduled tasks&quot; (why on earth is that a model and not a tool that the other models can use!?)<p>Why do I have to figure all of this out myself?",
        "Numbers for SWE-bench Verified, Aider Polyglot, cost per million output tokens, output tokens per second, and knowledge cutoff month&#x2F;year:<p><pre><code>             SWE  Aider Cost Fast Fresh\n Claude 3.7  70%  65%   $15  77   8&#x2F;24\n Gemini 2.5  64%  69%   $10  200  1&#x2F;25\n GPT-4.1     55%  53%   $8   169  6&#x2F;24\n DeepSeek R1 49%  57%   $2.2 22   7&#x2F;24\n Grok 3 Beta ?    53%   $15  ?    11&#x2F;24\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m not sure this is really an apples-to-apples comparison as it may involve different test scaffolding and levels of &quot;thinking&quot;.

        "don&#x27;t miss that OAI also published a prompting guide WITH RECEIPTS for GPT 4.1 specifically for those building agents... with a new recommendation for:<p>- telling the model to be persistent (+20%)<p>- dont self-inject&#x2F;parse toolcalls (+2%)<p>- prompted planning (+4%)<p>- JSON BAD - use XML or  arxiv 2406.13121 (GDM format)<p>- put instructions + user query at TOP -and- BOTTOM - bottom-only is VERY BAD<p>- no evidence that ALL CAPS or Bribes or Tips or threats to grandma work<p>source: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cookbook.openai.com&#x2F;examples&#x2F;gpt4-1_prompting_guide#prompting-induced-planning--chain-of-thought\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cookbook.openai.com&#x2F;examples&#x2F;gpt4-1_prompting_guide#...</a>",

Across 200 real-world pull requests with the same prompts and conditions, they found that GPT‚Äë4.1 produced the better suggestion in 55% of cases. Notably, they found that GPT‚Äë4.1 excels at both precision (knowing when not to make suggestions) and comprehensiveness (providing thorough analysis when warranted).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.qodo.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;benchmarked-gpt-4-1&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.qodo.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;benchmarked-gpt-4-1&#x2F;</a>",
        "I have been trying GPT-4.1 for a few hours by now through Cursor on a fairly complicated code base. For reference, my gold standard for a coding agent is Claude Sonnet 3.7 despite its tendency to diverge and lose focus.<p>My take aways:<p>- This is the first model from OpenAI that feels relatively agentic to me (o3-mini sucks at tool use, 4o just sucks). It seems to be able to piece together several tools to reach the desired goal and follows a roughly coherent plan.<p>- There is still more work to do here. Despite OpenAI&#x27;s cookbook[0] and some prompt engineering on my side, GPT-4.1 stops quickly to ask questions, getting into a quite useless &quot;convo mode&quot;. Its tool calls fails way too often as well in my opinion.<p>- It&#x27;s also able to handle significantly less complexity than Claude, resulting in some comical failures. Where Claude would create server endpoints, frontend components and routes and connect the two, GPT-4.1 creates simplistic UI that calls a mock API despite explicit instructions. When prompted to fix it, it went haywire and couldn&#x27;t handle the multiple scopes involved in that test app.<p>- With that said, within all these parameters, it&#x27;s much less unnerving than Claude and it sticks to the request, as long as the request is not too complex.<p>My conclusion: I like it, and totally see where it shines, narrow targeted work, adding to Claude 3.7 - for creative work, and Gemini 2.5 Pro for deep complex tasks. GPT-4.1 does feel like a smaller model compared to these last two, but maybe I just need to use it for longer.<p>0: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cookbook.openai.com&#x2F;examples&#x2F;gpt4-1_prompting_guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cookbook.openai.com&#x2F;examples&#x2F;gpt4-1_prompting_guide</a>"

More power to the users.</i><p>I&#x27;ve changed my outlook on vibe coding after seeing the results of this wholesome vibe coding: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4pJUXocn7aE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4pJUXocn7aE</a> .<p>This guy didn&#x27;t just make a small program, he made a product that is attuned to some very stringent requirements. If you gave this project to experienced software developers it would be heavy on process and light on impact, take forever to make, and stupid expensive.",
        "&gt;they empower people with minimal development experience to create their own programs.<p>The author goes out of their way to play up the toy aspect of the LLMs when driven by the inexperienced.  No mention is made of them being used by experienced developers, but I get the impression he feels they aren&#x27;t useful to the experienced.<p>I&#x27;m just playing with a small client&#x2F;server tool (rsync but for block devices), and vibe coding allowed me to figure out some rough edges of my design document, and experiment with &quot;what would it look like built with threads?  As async code?  As procedural?)  I would never have done that before because of the sheer amount of time it would take, I&#x27;d have picked what I thought was best and then lived with the sunk cost falacy until I had no other choice.  It did a pretty good job of catching reasonable exceptions in the communication code which I probably would have just let throw a traceback until I got a bug report.  It did a great job of adding logging and debugging options.  And I had it take 4 attempts at making a &quot;fancy&quot; --progress display and picked the one I liked the best.<p>LLMs give a level of exploration to software development that we haven&#x27;t seen since the good old days when HP set up several groups to each build their next generation workstation environment, and then picked the best one.<p>IMHO, the experienced software developers stand at a unique position to take advantage of these LLMs that far outstrip what an inexperienced developer can do.",
        "Im so confused on what vibe coding is.<p>Is it:<p>- just pressing tab and letting copilot code whatever?<p>- asking an llm to do everything that it can and falling back on your own brain as needed or when its easier.<p>I guess probably more like the latter. I was just surprised to hear there was a special term for it. I thought everyone was doing that.",
        "Sometimes I want to cook a home meal.<p>If I wanted to open a large world class fast food chain, I wouldn&#x27;t be cooking home meals then. That would be silly.<p>Copilot can help me cook the equivalent of a McDonalds special in terms of software. It&#x27;s good, I think McDonalds is delicious.<p>But it cannot help me cook a home meal software. It will insist that my home made fries must go in a little red box, and my fish sandwich needs only half a slice of cheese.<p>Deeply into that metaphor, maybe someone who has only worked for fast food chains might forget that a lot of good industrial dishes are variations of what previously were home cooked meals.<p>I am glad that copilot can help young cooks to become fast food workers. That really looks like something.<p>Well, I take pleasure in cooking home meal software. Can you make a copilot that helps with that?<p>You know what, nevermind. I don&#x27;t need a copilot to cook home meals. I have a bunch of really good old books and I trust my taste.<p>It&#x27;s not like some big company is going to be interested in some random amateur dish, is it? It was definitely not cooked for them.",
        "The argument is that vibe coding is great for little personal programs but bad for full-blown products.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can ship a fully baked product made exclusively with AI coding yet. But it&#x27;s *really* useful for investigative product development - e.g. when you have a few different ideas for how something might work but aren&#x27;t quite sure what&#x27;s best. I used to regret that I never mastered Figma or other mockup tools - now I never will have to."
