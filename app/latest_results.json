        "Whether it's startup or big-company, I've always found that I get the best results when the functionality that i'm outsourcing is discrete and doesn't impact other work.  When i've been disappointed is when trying to outsource something that needs to be integrated into a larger project or ecosystem.  \n\nTo your example, i would probably NOT pay to have my pitch deck redesigned, but I may pay for a custom designed template or \"branding pack\" or style guide that i can reuse.  I wouldnt want my pitch deck to look completely different than my internal decks.",

        "One use case that I’ve seen done at 2 different startups that was incredibly useful: product renderings. They were both hardware companies and we used Fiverr workers to create gorgeous images of our (large and very expensive to build) products in use. For example, a grid battery installed next to a solar farm in the dessert. Super useful for one-pagers and pitch decks.",

        "Great thread. I run a dev company (Bossa Nova Solutions), and I’ve seen founders run into trouble when they hire multiple freelancers from different platforms. You get speed upfront, but often lose product cohesion and spend too much time coordinating instead of building.\n\nWhat’s worked for our partners — from early-stage startups to established companies in industries like golf, music, and education — is having a small, embedded team that acts more like co-founders than contractors. We care about the *whole product*, not just isolated tasks.\n\nFiverr and Upwork definitely have their place, but if you’re juggling growth, product design, and infrastructure all at once, having a unified team that owns the outcomes can be a big difference."

I would be hanging out in r/independentmechanics and seeing how many people post about how much trouble they have diagnosing mis-firing engines where you could offer suggestions of many different ways to diagnose (one of which being using sound clips).  You can get your ICP to start searching for your solution without directly promoting it. \n\nYou could also offer to help the mechanic without promoting directly.  \"hey I was having this same issue and it was frustrating the crap out of me, so i built a tool to solve it.  if you send me an audio recording of the mis-firing engine, i'm happy to run it through my tool and give you the output\".\n\nThat all said, why did you build this app?

Don’t promote, just start adding value or asking for feedback on parts of your app.\n2. **Set up a landing page** – explain what the app does + collect emails for beta access. Share that instead of the app link.\n3. **Document your process** – post updates on Reddit, Twitter, or Indie Hackers. Don’t push the app—share what you’re learning. That builds trust.\n\nFinally, evaluate/define for yourself who your real users are and try to target them in further growth stages: making new app screenshots and the whole ASO.\n\nStart with those.

Art this stage you should be running product dev interviews. Aim to have between 10-20 interviews with potential users and ask questions like:  \n\\* Have you experienced \\[Pain/Problem\\]?  \n\\* How do you go about solving that \\[Pain/Problem\\]?  \n\\* What happens if you don't solve \\[Pain/Problem\\]? What happens if you do?  \n\\* etc...\n\nHaving those interviews will help you:  \n\\* Get knowledge about how your potential users/buyers talk about the  \\[Pain/Problem\\], angles you can use when reaching out, and more importantly how to design the product itself. \n\nHappy to expand on this if you give me more context on what you want to achieve.",

The next question is, do you want to get the remaining 10% out and have this as a passive income vehicle? Start considering exit strategies? Do you know the valuation multiples for your industry? Or do you want to continue to grow significantly? What I generally tell my clients is that owning a business is a constant game of delegating out higher and higher level tasks so you yourself can operate at a higher and higher level. If you are not replacing those tasks with more valuable ones, then that is helpful to you but not to the business. In fact, if that's what you are doing, you are just putting more strain on the business. And that's 100% your right and not a problem at all, but just something to be observant of depending on what your goals are. If you are completely lost about what should be happening next, then it might be time to consider hiring more senior leadership, or bringing in a CEO with experience in your industry who can get you from where you are now to 5-10x.\n\n\nMy main question would be though, do you have the business architecture that you need in place to be growing?

Destroyed the friendship for me. \n\nFor the record, I never expected them to pay back borrowed money for food or medicine. I was happy to help. Those kids were like my kids, too.

He then listed entirely everything about me that annoyed him and every mistake and flaw I had that he knew about. Since he was my best friend, it was a lot. There was no sign this was coming. We had only ever argued a couple of times. I never knew that so much about me was so distasteful to him. I was devastated. \n\nA couple of weeks later, he called and came over until I spoke to him. He was very apologetic- for reasons I would have completely understood had he told me, he had a breakdown and realized he needed to live on his own. Knowing it was going to mess things up for me, he made it my fault. He said he didn't mean any of it and was horrified about how he treated me. Yet it was so detailed and specific, going back years to incidents that I had no idea were an issue. There was just no fixing it. I could never feel comfortable and trust him again. On one hand, I miss people I used to know. I don't miss him or think of him often or with nostalgic fondness. My daughter doesn't know who he is when she comes across old pictures of us, but she knows about other old friends, since I mention them. On the other hand...\n\nIt's been 20 years. It's hard for me to have close friends still, because I feel like they may be building lists of things I do wrong and ways I just am wrong and awful. And maybe they'll call one day when I least expect it and list it all. \n\nIt wasn't good."

        "Architecturally, it is a scale-out metadata filesystem [ref]. Other related distributed file systems are Collosus, Tectonic (Meta), ADLSv2 (Microsoft), HopsFS (Hopsworks), and I think PolarFS (Alibaba). They all use different distributed row-oriented DBs for storing metadata. S3FS uses FoundationDB, Collosus uses BigTable, Tectonic some KV store, ADLSv2 (not sure), HopsFS uses RonDB.<p>What&#x27;s important here with S3FS is that it supports (1) a fuse client - it just makes life so much easiter - and (2) NVMe storage - so that training pipelines aren&#x27;t Disk I&#x2F;O bound (you can&#x27;t always split files small enough and parallel reading&#x2F;writing enough to a S3 object store).<p>Disclaimer: i worked on HopsFS. HopsFS adds tiered storage - NVMe for recent data and S3 for archival.<p>[ref]:  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hopsworks.ai&#x2F;post&#x2F;scalable-metadata-the-new-breed-of-file-systems\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hopsworks.ai&#x2F;post&#x2F;scalable-metadata-the-new-bree...</a>",
        "I think that the author is spot on, there are a couple of dimensions in which you should evaluate these systems: theoretical limits, efficiency, and practical limits.<p>From a theoretical point of view, like others have pointed out, parallel distributed file systems have existed for years -- most notably Lustre. These file systems should be capable of scaling out their storage and throughput to, effectively, infinity -- if you add enough nodes.<p>Then you start to ask, well how much storage and throughput can I get with a node that has X TiB of disk -- starting to evaluate efficiency. I ran some calculations (against FSx for Lustre, since I&#x27;m an AWS guy) -- and it appears that you can run 3FS in AWS for about 12-30% cheaper depending on the replication factors that you choose against FSxL (which is good, but not great considering that you&#x27;re now managing the cluster yourself).<p>Then, the third thing you start to ask is anecdotally, are people able to actually configure these file systems into the size of deployment that I want (which is where you hear things like &quot;oh it&#x27;s hard to get Ceph to 1 TiB&#x2F;s&quot;) -- and that remains to be seen from something like 3FS.<p>Ultimately, I obviously believe that storage and data are really important keys to how these AI companies operate -- so it makes sense that DeepSeek would build something like this in-house to get the properties that they&#x27;re looking for. My hope is that we, at Archil, can find a better set of defaults that work for most people without needing to manage a giant cluster or even worry about how things are replicated.",
