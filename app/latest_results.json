The real problem is that the bar for new apps has dramatically increased so the old wisdom of make some janky product that has that min value is no longer the case. Now you need a bare min quality that everyone is accustomed to with max value for that one singular value proposition where other features can be added.\n\nSo this means tons and tons of tiny little fixes and standard additions that are common for most sites. The biggest shock was seeing how many new users came from mobile. Our app is canvas-based dealing with a lot of information. The thought of using this on mobile puts a horrible taste in my mouth because it makes zero sense to use it on mobile. But unfortunately, the numbers don't lie so now we're scrambling to optimize for mobile as well so we don't lose half of the prospective customers that show up. \n\nUnbelievably insane that people use mobile most of the time for apps like ours that are geared towards complicated data structuring...like I totally get it for social media and smaller things, but for something like this...idk. I can be convinced that people prefer mobile, but I can never convince myself to use mobile for this specific app lol. It's a crazy cognitive dissonance but big lesson is this.

      "selftext": "(I will not promote)\n\n  \nSharing something I dug up for my '**Startup Marketing**' newsletter this week. In my quest to understand how enterprise products did early stage marketing, I ended up studying Coupa’s early growth and it is a gem if you're trying to crack into a mature market without a big budget.\n\n**First, a little about Coupa:**\n\n* Coupa is a **business spend management platform** — basically, they help big companies manage procurement, expenses, and suppliers.\n* They started in 2006, IPO'd in 2016, and were acquired for **$8 Billion** in 2022.\n* Coupa entered a market ruled by *giants* like SAP, Oracle, and Ariba... and still won.\n\nTheir early stage marketing is worth studying because they broke into a **mature, dominated market** — without raising huge funding rounds or burning millions on ads.\n\n**Their Marketing Strategy**\n\nCoupa’s growth strategy wasn’t to fight incumbents head-on — it was to expand the market. Their goal was to make procurement software accessible to companies of all sizes, especially those that couldn’t afford Oracle or SAP. Procurement software back then was **only** for massive enterprises with big IT budgets.\n\nSo they had a simple goal: Get in front of finance and procurement teams who wanted to streamline their purchasing process but lacked the budget or IT capacity for heavyweight solutions.\n\n**Here’s how Coupa pulled it off:**\n\n1. **Launched an open-source version** — almost unheard of in procurement tech at the time.\n2. **Built it fast** using Ruby on Rails (lean team, limited resources).\n3. **Distributed through SourceForge** — the #1 open-source project platform (500K+ visits/month back then).\n4. **Leveraged founder’s reputation** — Dave Stephens (ex-Oracle) ran a popular blog and had deep connections in procurement circles.\n5. **Created organic buzz** — early coverage from procurement bloggers (like Spend Matters) and trade publications.\n\n**The impact?**\n\n* 460+ downloads in Month 1.\n* 10,000+ downloads in Year 1.\n* Built a strong early adopter base before launching their SaaS (paid) version.\n\nEven a modest 10% free-to-paid conversion would have given them \\~$1M ARR, as their early ACV was north of $15K.\n\n**Why it worked:**\n\n* Open source killed friction — no huge sales cycles, no approvals needed to try it.\n* They expanded the market — making procurement software accessible to smaller companies, not just enterprises.\n* And when the paid version dropped, they already had trust and familiarity.\n\n**Fast forward: Coupa went public and eventually got acquired for $8B.**\n\nI broke down the full story (with more tactical details) — dropped the link in the comments if you want to check it out. 👇",

      "selftext": "Hey,\n\nlast year, I started a restaurant in a Czech city (Ostrava) with someone who was still my friend back then and now I don’t know what to do anymore—I’m completely drained... My ex-friend was the chef and was supposed to be the cornerstone of our whole idea, but unfortunately, before we even managed to open, he bailed on me. I was suddenly facing a tough decision: either go through with it alone or give up... I decided to push forward and honestly, looking back now, I’m not sure if I made the right call... But I didn’t really have much of a choice—I had already rented the place, had all the equipment, suppliers, and staff lined up...\n\nThe first month looked promising, it worked fairly well because people saw a new place and came to check it out... It brought in money, customers were mostly happy, everyone seemed satisfied—except the damn staff and me... Why? Because I was literally sleeping at the restaurant, my entire life outside of it fell apart and I still hate the place, even though I spend 16 hours there every single day... Still doing good when it comes to money, BUT.\n\nEven though I hired two chefs, both turned out to be complete idiots who, for some reason, just couldn’t function. I’ve gone through maybe ten different people (both experienced and fresh out of school), and every single time, I had to yell at them because it always ended with me doing their job... Same story with the waitresses. One working behind the bar, one on the floor serving food... Guess what? One of them did everything, while the other spent every 30 minutes on the phone or out smoking. Meanwhile, the one who was running around like crazy would come up to me after a week and say she was done and that I could go to hell...\n\nSo it’s been one disaster after another. Everything works—except the staff. And from what I’ve heard from others in this business, it’s the same everywhere... I don’t know what to do anymore, how to find someone actually willing to work... I offer fair conditions—average pay (and I always try to be flexible, if their base pay is low, they get the rest in cash), plus they’re all getting state support too, so in the end they make more money than I do. And then I show up in the morning, and instead of the kitchen guys prepping everything for lunch like they should be, they bitch at me—and I have to do it myself... Like everything.\n\nYesterday I couldn’t take it anymore and fired them both... I had to close for the weekend and now I have no idea what to do—whether to give up or find some new idiot to take their place... I’ve gone through so many people and no one in this industry is willing to actually work...\n\n**How do you, in the rest of the world, motivate lazy people? How do you do it elsewhere?**  \nBecause I seriously have no idea anymore. They laugh in my face every single day, and I’m the one paying for their little comedy show. I’m working myself into the ground like a pig and somehow they’re ending up with more than me...",

Find out what their needs and wants are and give them those.

In fact, the CEO roundtable I was invited to, spends 1/3 of the time navigating problems relating to employees. These are of successful businesses.\n\nThe food industry is hard. It invites people that may not be as motivated as you are (not saying they all are unmotivated). It's just harder to sift through and find the good ones.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, you're trying to figure out an industry that you don't personally have experience in. Not sure why you would have proceeded after the friend bailed. If you wanted to do it anyways, you should have gotten a job at another business and learned the ropes first. Honestly, even a chef might not have been the right partner. A manager at a successful restaurant would have been much better.\n\nYou can try to poach someone from a good restaurant, but you would likely need to offer equity at this point. You can't coax them with similar pay. Even 10% more and they're smart they wouldn't take it. You want someone smart.\n\nGood luck."

        "I made something up on the spot that saved a guys life. \n\nMotorcycle crash. Dude comes in agitated, breathing rapidly, has the “I’m dying” look in his eyes. We intubate him for low oxygen levels, and it’s just….not working. The tubes in the right place but now he has two massive pneumothoraxes (collapsed lungs) and with every breath he is pouring air out of the chest tubes I placed. Air is going in, but not making it into his lungs. There’s an airway injury somewhere and it’s big. I tell my ED colleagues to get a bronchoscope ready because we’re going to do the fastest CT ever and figure out what’s injured.\n\nHe barely survives being in the CT scanner. We get one pass through and speed him back to the ED so we can figure out the next step. As the CT images come across, it’s worst case scenario. His trachea is completely severed and forcing air to go through has created this large, air filled gap in his neck meat between the two ends of his windpipe. Every breath we force in there takes the path of least resistance, meaning into the chest cavity and out the draining chest tubes, but NOT into his lungs. \n\nSo basically he won’t survive long enough for us to try and surgically fix it. But if we could just push the breathing tube down to the lower segment, we would be able to help him breathe again. So in a moment of inspiration, I tell my respiratory tech to set up the bronchoscope. I stick the scope in the breathing tube (like usual) and have the ED doc helping me pull the tube most of the way out. And there it was! \n\nOnce the ET tube was pulled back, my bronchoscope was basically sitting in what felt like a giant cavern of neck meat, all stretched out from forcing so many breaths down the ET tube. And at the end of this cavern was the other end of his trachea. In reality, this “cavern” was probably 15 mm wide at the most, but I was locked on and drove that bronch straight down the middle and into the lower segment of his trachea. Once I had the scope in I basicallly rammed it as far down into his lung as it would go and the ED doc rammed the breathing tube over the bronch, down into the lower segment. We pulled out the bronch and gave a few breaths….there was no leaking. His chest rose with each breath. His oxygen was back at 100% within 45 seconds. \n\nWe got him up to the OR and about 6 hours later had fixed him up and he survived that night. \n\nThe best feeling, though, is when a renowned otolaryngologist whom we called in to help with the tracheal repair asked how I got the tube down into the lower part of the trachea. I described what we had done in the ED, and he just goes, “How?! That’s not a thing!”",
        "Not me, but my attending. We had an older guy with new severe hip pain but his x ray and MRI was normal. Things were just…off and she felt like there was more going on. We got an MRI of his spine and lo and behold he had a huge honking spinal abscess. Most of the time you would expect to see weakness or sensory changes with a spinal abscess - he had none of that. We imaged his whole spine and found a couple more spots of infection. So we imaged his brain. Big old abscess. We also got a heart ultrasound (echo) that ended up showing a massive infection sitting on one of his heart valves. He had literally zero symptoms except this sudden onset hip pain. \n\nLong story short we think his bad diverticulitis let some bacteria into his blood and he was unlucky enough to have it seed his heart valve. He ended up doing great with a truckload of antibiotics!",
        "Not a huge mystery, but one that drove me nuts for 4 years as a dentist was this guy who had severe acid erosion on all is teeth, but one area in particular was super bad. I figured he had to be obsessively eating something acidic and chewing it with one side of his mouth. I would interrogate him at every single visit (and there were tons of visits because he was totally destroying his teeth) to figure out what the hell was causing it. I probably asked the guy 50 times over 4 years if he liked to eat sour candy. Always said \"not really.\" \n\n\nOne day we had a long appointment together and I just decided to name every sour candy I could think of while I worked. Captive audience. When I said Cry Baby's, he was like \"Mmm I like those, they're so sour!\" Come to find out he was eating 1-2 bags a day. Dude. What did you think I was asking about when I asked if you liked to eat sour candy all of these years?!?!? ",

        "There’s an aspect of this that is not readily apparent unless you were a web developer around the time this was created.<p>Before CSS, layouts were implemented by abusing table elements to create a grid. Then images were sliced up into sections, and each section was placed into the table. This has generally been remembered in the present day, however what seems to have been forgotten was the pushback against CSS.<p>There was a large number of web developers who were happy with the status quo and refused to learn CSS. One of the most persistent myths was that you couldn’t make anything look nice with CSS. Specifically, CSS was accused of only being able to create “boring, boxy” designs.<p>It wasn’t true at all. Even back in the early days of CSS, you could create great layouts. It was especially absurd because the approach favoured by the people saying this was literally abusing tables to create grids.<p>So along comes Dave Shea and points out that this is ridiculous, that CSS is capable of great designs, and puts the CSS Zen Garden up. A whole bunch of people contribute good-looking designs and make it impossible for people to claim that “CSS can only produce boring, boxy designs”.

I&#x27;ve seen discussions on W3C where it was like &quot;Well if you add another div around this you can achieve this effect, so why do we need a new CSS property?&quot;.  Stuff like inserting or swapping an image is simple, but swapping a styleable SVG is impossible because the SVG nodes need to be directly embedded in the html.<p>So you&#x27;re forced to mix presentation and content structuring decisions at the HTML and Javascript levels and even some simple design changes require modifications throughout the stack.",

        "I play competitive Geoguessr at a fairly high level, and I wanted to test this out to see how it compares.<p>It&#x27;s astonishingly good.<p>It will use information it knows about you to arrive at the answer - it gave me the exact trailhead of a photo I took locally, and when I asked it how, it mentioned that it knows I live nearby.<p>However, I&#x27;ve given it vacation photos from ages ago, and not only in tourist destinations either. It got them all as good or better than a pro human player would. Various European, Central American, and US locations.<p>The process for how it arrives at the conclusion is somewhat similar to humans. It looks at vegetation, terrain, architecture, road infrastructure, signage, and it just knows seemingly everything about all of them.<p>Humans can do this too, but it takes many thousands of games or serious study, and the results won&#x27;t be as broad. I have a flashcard deck with hundreds of entries to help me remember road lines, power poles, bollards, architecture, license plates, etc. These models have more than an individual mind could conceivably memorize.",
        "&gt; I’m confident it didn’t cheat and look at the EXIF data on the photograph, because if it had cheated it wouldn’t have guessed Cambria first.<p>It also, at one point, said it couldn&#x27;t see any image data at all.  You absolutely cannot trust what it says.<p>You need to re-run with the EXIF data removed.",
        "For all of the images I&#x27;ve tried, the base model (e.g. 4o) already has a ~95% accurate idea of where the photo is, and then o3 does so much tool use only to confirm its intuition from the base model and slightly narrow down. For OP&#x27;s initial image, 4o in fact provides a more accurate initial guess of Carmel-by-the-Sea (d=~100mi &lt; 200mi), and its next guess is also Half Moon Bay, although it did not figure out the exact town of El Granada [0].<p>The clue is in the CoT - you can briefly see the almost correct location as the very first reasoning step. The model then apparently seems to ignore it and try many other locations, a ton of tool use, etc, always coming back to the initial guess.<p>For pictures where the base model has no clue, I haven&#x27;t seen o3 do anything smart, it just spins in circles.<p>I believe the model has been RL-ed to death in a way that incentivizes correct answers no matter the number of tools used.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chatgpt.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;680d011a-9470-8002-97a0-a0d2b067eacf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chatgpt.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;680d011a-9470-8002-97a0-a0d2b067eacf</a>",
        "Feels like privacy is becoming this quaint, old-fashioned idea we&#x27;re all just pretending still exists",
        "I added a section just now with something I had missed: o3 DOES have a loose model of your location fed into it, which I believe is intended to support the new search feature (so it can run local searches).<p>The thinking summary it showed me did not reference that information, but it&#x27;s still very possible that it used that in its deliberations.<p>I ran two extra example queries for photographs I&#x27;ve taken thousands of miles away (in Buenos Aires and Madagascar) - EXIF stripped - and it did a convincing job with both of those as well: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwillison.net&#x2F;2025&#x2F;Apr&#x2F;26&#x2F;o3-photo-locations&#x2F;#update-o3-does-have-rough-location-access\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simonwillison.net&#x2F;2025&#x2F;Apr&#x2F;26&#x2F;o3-photo-locations&#x2F;#up...</a>"
