        "I went through this several years ago except it was closer to $250K. The reason they didn't pay wasn't out of spite, it was an overall lack of funding. Just be sure you measure your outputs of cash vs. their viability to pay. Just because you get a judgment means you'll get your money back. You may spend $5000 to get there and have $45K in sunk costs while they go out of business.",

Some states can protect you under their department of labor (like California) but if you and the company are in different states their help can only get so far. I was in a similar position and got legal consults but no one would take the case if the amount owed was under $50k. They said with legal payouts it just wasn’t worth their time, and that I wouldn’t end up getting much of the money back either. In my situation I had to take an L and it took me 3 years to recover from it…",

It’s possible that You’ll spend more on an attorney suing them than they have to pay you; I totally get being pissed and being in the right, but sometimes it’s just not worth the emotional energy.",
        "You might be a misclassified employee - but assuming you're a legitimate 1099 contractor, there should be a contract that clearly lays out what your responsibilities are and what they need to pay you once you complete your responsibilities. Personally, I'd encourage you to sue. You're rolling the dice with probably around 10k in initial attorney fees to get you past the intake/complaint/service/etc. but there's a decent chance you can settle.\n\nAlso, being sued is a major buzz kill for a startup looking to get more funding. Explain to them what your next steps will be and what the consequences to them will be if they do not cooperate in resolving this early.",

Fake-door test?

Go into FB groups, slack groups, etc groups that fit within my target market and post the waitlist with a tantalizing offer.\n\nLots of ways to validate, just try and experiment.

This post is specific for US based individuals where our health care options are generally…bad. Being in my 40s not having health insurance was not an option so when I moved to working full time at my startup I needed to find coverage. I am the only full time employee and my cofounders both have health insurance through their other means. \n\nI could tell you about how many hours I spent scouring the internet for pricing and plans, comparing, scheduling calls with the very few companies that claim to be startup friendly. I was looking for a national PPO (I travel a lot for work and most of my Dr appointments are things like getting strep after a big conference) and I have one speciality orthopedist I wanted to keep seeing. The options were…dismal. The best I found on my own was an EPO with regional coverage. At least my orthopedist was in network. \n\nTLDR I ended up going an ICRHA that provides pre-tax dollar reimbursement to me from the company (a tax benefit for my startup) and working with an individual broker I actually found on here who has an excellent selection of plans with national coverage, with many options under $500/month.  I’m not sure what constitutes promotion but feel free to DM me if you want either of these names. Both companies were extremely responsive to my questions and I was onboarded within 48 hours, no phone calls and online the necessary amount of admin/paperwork required. Just getting quotes on my own was Feb times more of headache. \n\nJust wanted to share my experience for any small teams out there looking for options! \n\nI will not promote. \n\nI will not promote ",

I worked in large companies during a long time and I recall the challenges on shipping new software due to the scarce coding skillset in the market.\n\nThis is not something we see anymore. Even agreeing there will always be space for the most experienced developers to operate, I see the best ones learning marketing, design and focusing on systems engineering rather than coding.\n\nPersonally, I feel as entrepreneurs we finally have time to explore the full business spectrum without the need of specializing in specific areas to ship a disruptive product.\n\nI started piloting and refining how a technical solopreneur can leverage AI to free his time to innovate on other aspects of the business and I wonder whether it would be relevant from some of you guys to see the results.\n\nHave you thought about this? Curious about your thoughts!",

        "Yeah interesting question\n\nOne thing though; entrepreneurship is definitely a social sport. Sometimes the winners are the most connected ones.\n\nThe term ‘solopreneur’ is dangerous in the sense of isolating yourself from ineraction with real customers and buyers.\n\nBusiness = connections x value",
        "Hey, I think I get what you're saying, but I'm not convinced solopreneurs can skip specialty areas entirely. Yeah, it's cool that tools like AI and no-code platforms make tech more accessible, but you still gotta have some grip on the fundamentals. I tried using AI to streamline content creation for my projects, but oh man, the AI’s quirks sometimes made the content sound robotic. It took a while before I found the right balance between automation and my personal touch.\n\nAlso, while it's tempting to go solo, remember collaboration can spark innovation. Working with folks smarter than me has been a game-changer. They kinda push me to see things from angles I wouldn't have thought of alone. So even if you’re capable of handling everything, it doesn’t mean you should. I’m all for leveraging tech to free up time, but sometimes the best ideas happen when you're working with a great team. So yeah, dive into all those business aspects, but don't count out the value of a good collaboration. I'm really curious to hear about your AI experience though... does it really feel like it's lifting much of the technical burden?",

        "This is really cool<p>One thing I&#x27;d suggest, for any hardware product, is that when doing your bill of materials to provide links and show estimated costs. Sure, these will change but having a rough idea of the costs is really helpful, especially when perusing on from things like HN. It can be a big difference for someone to decide if they want to try it on their own or not. It is the ballpark figures that matter, not the specifics.<p>You did all that research, write it down. If for no one but yourself! Providing links is highly helpful because names can be funky and helps people (including your future self) know if this is the same thing or not. It&#x27;s always noisy, but these things reduce noise. Importantly, they take no time while you&#x27;re doing the project (you literally bought the parts, so you have the link and the price). It saves yourself a lot of hassle, not just for others. Document because no one remembers anything after a few days or weeks. It takes 10 seconds to write it down and 30 minutes to do the thing all over again, so be lazy and document. I think this is one of the biggest lessons I learned when I started as an engineer.
