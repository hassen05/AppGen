      "selftext": "A few months back, we were hiring for a front-end role. We received over 600 applications and shortlisted 100. Instead of diving into long interviews or sending out take-home assignments, we did something simple.   \"i will not promote\" \n\nWe shared a 5-page study doc on the basics of UX, just enough to level the playing field. Then we spent 15 minutes with each person, asking twisted conceptual questions based only on that material. That’s all it took.\n\nIt gave everyone a sort of  fair shot. And from their answers, we could immediately see who could learn fast, think deeply, and apply creatively.\n\nThe thing is, startups can’t afford to hire for knowledge. There’s a disproportionate premium on it in the market, and big companies can pay that. Most startups simply can’t.\n\nBut what we can do is bet on potential. On people who pick things up quickly, who care about what they build, and who are kind and driven enough to work well with others.\n\nWhat I really dislike is when companies give out long assignments or ask candidates to work with internal boilerplate codes and call it “assessment.” That’s not assessment, it’s disguised exploitation. You’re asking someone to work for free without hiring them. And the worst part is, the candidate can’t even say anything because the power dynamics are too skewed. One side is offering a job, the other is just hoping.\n\nThat’s why our approach worked so well.\n\nOut of 100 candidates, ten stood out. One of them was still in college. I was skeptical. Our CTO insisted. She joined as an intern.\n\nAnd she’s now outperforming people with years of experience. Not because she knew everything, but because she learned fast, executed consistently, and took feedback without ego.\n\nIt sounds like common sense, but only once you’ve lived through it.\n\nStartups should optimize for learning ability, not experience. And the smartest ones do it in ways that are humane, fair, and simple.\n\nThat’s the only hiring framework we follow, and it’s worked beautifully.\n\nCurious to know how others approach hiring in early-stage teams. What has worked for you\n\n ",

        "I guess every person is unique and usually a new joiner shows better performance than the existing one. When I joined my first company many with 5 years experience were doing 10 tasks per day and I was doing 18-20 on a daily basis. This helped me to move through different teams to learn new things but financially it never helped.\nAlthough I miss my old self but honestly if you ask me today to do the same task 18-20 daily I won't be able to do it because of lack of motivation. That time I had a motivation to learn and show the world I can do something.",
        "I can tell you what did not work for us as a startup - not having the time to interview 100 candidates hoping we hit jackpot. We had great deal of success interviewing a few experienced candidates. From previous experience, hiring fresh grads worked when we had a great training/onboarding program geared towards them, and the luxury to pay for all that both in money & time.\n\nIm glad it worked for you.",
        "Sorry but you will soon find out why you don’t get interns to build your products. Even experienced devs struggle with this, it’s scalability of code. Anyone can write code but only few can write scalable code. Anyways gluck",
        "She is am exception, by definition, or the other candidates were all coincidentally quite bad at what they do for a living.\n\nEither way, companies do typically hire based on a combination of existing skill, perceived ability to learn & grow, work ethic, etc. I don't think this is necessarily some revelation but maybe some startups need to hear it. For obvious reasons people with no work experience or demonstrable skills often won't even get the interview, because you can't burn a bunch of runaway interviewing every breathing human who applies."

      "selftext": "So many moons ago I was running an online automotive marketplace that was doing fairly well, but hadn't taken any funding.\n\nOne day I get a call from Roelof Botha, who some of you know is the Managing Partner of Sequoia.  But back then (this is 2003-ish) he was just an associate pounding the phones looking for deals, and he came across my company.\n\nUp until this point I had never raised a penny in my life, but I knew exactly who Sequoia was, and when he called and asked if we were raising my answer was basically \"Sure, if you're investing...\"  I would imagine they get a lot of that.\n\nThey wanted me to fly from Columbus, Ohio to their offices on Sand Hill Road.  I knew absolutely nothing about what it meant to prep a pitch deck (which is ironic because I now help people with this for a living) or how to answer any questions, but I was really good at face-to-face sales because I had run an ad agency for a decade.\n\nI fly to Menlo Park and show up wearing a suit - mistake one.  I was used to big agency pitches where people still wore suits to presentations (back then).  I looked like I was going to church, or a funeral.. or any event but a Silicon Valley VC pitch.  It did not go un-noticed.\n\nThe moment the meeting started, Roelof, who BTW is one of the kindest guys in VC, told me how much he appreciated me flying all the way out and how he had asked another partner if he'd join us.  But not just any partner - the partner - the legendary Mike Moritz.  Mike's list of deals could fill a NASCAR car - Google, Yahoo!, PayPal, Linkedin - all the darlings of that era.\n\nMike Moritz, as it happens, s NOT the kindest guy in VC.  He immediately laid into me with no hesitation and started asking questions that at the time I had never heard \"So what are you doing with your CPA? (Cost per Acquisition, we call it \"CAC\" now) and my answer was \"We don't have a CPA, currently\"  I literally thought he meant who is our accountant.  That did not go over well.\n\nMike was very clear about how unprepared and incompetent I was.  While feeling humiliated I also thought \"Dude, you called ME\".  But I persisted.  I explained how quickly our metrics were improving (even if I apparently didn't know what they were called...) and that I thought this could be a billion dollar company, if not more.  I think they saw a glimmer of hope, but quickly showed me the door anyway.  I assumed that was the end of it.\n\nOn my way back to my airport hotel next to SFO, ready to head home, Roelof calls me and says \"They really liked what they saw - we want you to come to the partner's meeting on Monday if you're willing to stay the weekend.\"\n\nI was shocked.  It was maybe the worst feeling I had ever had coming out of a sales meeting and I had been on hundreds.\n\nRegardless, I showed up on Monday ready to give it a second shot.  I had never been to a partners meeting, and I had no idea what that meant or the significance.  It would be like getting invited to play in the SuperBowl but you didn't really know what football was.\n\nThe partner meeting is where ALL of the partners of the firm show up to get pitched together.  It's the big show.  I got up there in my out-of-place suit, and fired away about the future of this startup.\n\nThat's when one of the partners, Mark Kvamme, simply asked \"So how are you looking at your TAM?\"  (For those that aren't familiar, \"TAM\" means Total Addressable Market and it means how many people could possibly buy your product, even if not all of them bought from you.)\n\nI had no goddamn clue what a \"TAM\" was.  I panicked, and I did I what I had learned when I was coming up in the agency business in my early 20's - I flipped the question.\n\n\"Before I dig in, can you give me a sense for how you're looking at it, so I'm answering the question properly?\"  The idea there is to see if they will give you some context clues before you completely bomb out.  Mark didn't take the bait - \"No, just tell me how you're seeing it.\"\n\nTotally f\\*cked.  When you sit in front of arguably the smartest, most successful VC's in the world, you probably should know what your goddamn market size is.  I didn't even know what the term for my market size was.  (bc life is weird, Kvamme and I would end up re-connecting years later when he moved to Columbus, Ohio of all places).\n\nI've been in a lot of big pitches prior to that, and some way bigger than this, but I don't think I've ever seen the sheer disdain from a group of people that I saw on the faces of the people in that room, at that moment.  I truly earned that reaction.\n\nThey were very professional, but I'm well aware when I've completely bombed, it usually happens when you see each of the people on the other side of the table exchange glances, and then collectively agree that you should get the hell out of the room.\n\nRoelof dutifully escorted me out, past what has to be the biggest collection of \"tombstones\" (investment banker speak for 'companies we took IPO or had a huge sale') that I've ever seen in my life.  It was like a reminder of who I wouldn't become.\n\nOn my way back home, he called and informed me that Sequoia would not be investing \"in this round\" (beautiful phrasing btw) and how much they would love to stay in touch.  I've been told \"no\" from nearly every VC that's out there at some point in my career, but to this day, no one made me feel better about it than he did.  I've always held so much respect for that, because it's not an easy call to make.\n\nSo, I went back to my little corner of the world and just kept bootstrapping.  The company would go on to be very profitable and still privately held today (not by me).  I would go on to start 3 more venture funded companies (incidentally, none by Sequoia...)\n\nI share this for those of you who are fundraising for the first time - I do this for a living (31 years as a startup Founder) and have helped other startups raise over a billion dollars, and I still didn't know jack shit going into this - there's no reason you would either!\n\nI also share this with my fellow Founders who may have gone through this same experience and can appreciate what it feels to get completely shut down on the pitch.\n\nIt happens to all of us.\n\nSide note - Soon after meeting with me, Roelof would meet the Founders of YouTube and land his first major investment, which apparently went better than mine, and is what put him on the track to become Managing Partner he is today.\n\n(I will not promote)",

      "selftext": "Here's a YC success case study of using hyper-specific micro-campaigns to drive a ton of B2B enterprise sales.\n\nThe core ideas:\n\n1. Start with tiny lists (10-100 prospects). Instead of massive csvs with 10k+ prospects, use lists so specific the list *itself* basically writes the messaging. Think \"Series A founders in X niche who recently hired Y role\". Use tools like Clay for enrichment.\n\n2. List = Messaging. Because the list criteria are so tight, the email angle should be super relevant right off the bat. Less generic BS, more \"I saw you specifically did...\"\n\n3. Multi-Channel Punch: Uploaded the *same* micro-lists for LinkedIn connection requests (directly from founder profiles). Accepted connection => relevant, manual DM. Hit email + LinkedIn in the same short window.\n\n4. Founder Content: Posted 4-5 valuable LinkedIn pieces weekly (wins, insights, even personal stuff). Keeps you top-of-mind and builds authority.\n\n5. Engager Outbound: Scrape LinkedIn post likers/commenters, enriched, and run *another* targeted outbound sequence if they fit the ICP. (Basically, \"Hey, saw you liked my post on X, thought you might find Y interesting...\")\n\nIn summary, it's all about creating a wall of sound with high-quality, relevant touches, not just volume. More upfront work on list building and personalization, but way fewer crickets and way more actual meetings booked.\n\ntldr; more targetting, less blasting.\n\nI will not promote",

Knowing when to expand heavily, who to partner with, where to take the product, and who to target makes a huge difference. \n\nThe problem with underestimating decision-making and overestimating 'execution' is that you spend too much time perfecting internal processes and talking about ownership... and too little care in decisions that can either put you in cruise control, or aim you at a brick wall. \n\nFor me, I'd rank it:\n\n\\- WHAT you are doing ('the strategy') --> 40%\n\n\\- WHO you are doing it with ('the people') --> 40% \n\n\\- HOW you are doing it ('the day-to-day execution') --> 20%\n\nDo you agree?\n\n(I will not promote)",

Things like: how do you respond to user feedback, when to pivot or double down, what feature to prioritize next. \n\nIn a startup you're not pausing to \"do strategy\" once a quarter. Most startups, including mine, follow some form of Agile ... which is built on the idea that strategy is something you uncover through execution, not separate from it.\n\nSo in that sense I disagree with how you separate the two. But if you combine your percentages for strategy and execution ... I would agree that most VCs and founders would say \"execution (which includes strategy)\" make up roughly 60% and the team 40% of a company's success.",

It was pretty cool, and it uses charts, timelines, and graphs to do some of it.\n\nSo the inspiration basically went from creating a very specific type of infographic tool to something that everybody could use to create any type of infographic. And this was before Canva, this was before any sort of simple-to-use drag-and-drop design tool. And people were still using Photoshop or Illustrator to do these kinds of designs or these kinds of infographics. So the inspiration came from that and said, how can we let non-designers, like everybody, create infographics? \n\n**The first version was bad but people still paid**\n\nIt took us around six months to build the MVP (minimum viable product). The download feature barely worked. Our users would complain and we’d have to fix the files manually and send them back. Even so, we gated the core features and started charging from day one.\n\nThat decision changed everything. People were actually paying for a tool that was kind of broken. That’s when I knew there was real demand.\n\n**We made $50K in year one doing custom work**\n\nWe didn’t hit $1M fast. In the first year we made about $50K. Most of it came from custom infographic work we did for agencies and large clients. I remember we had one contract with an agency that worked with companies like Ford. We even worked with Facebook. But we were charging very little. something like $20K for the entire year.\n\n**Content and SEO made all the difference**\n\nIt wasn’t until year two or three that things really started moving. The biggest driver of traffic and conversions was content and SEO. We started publishing blog posts around high intent keywords. We were a visual tool, so we focused on both written and visual content. That helped us rank and start bringing in traffic.\n\nWe were pitched by agencies offering links on blogs for $1K to $5K per placement. We couldn’t afford that. So we reverse engineered their process. They were just doing guest posting. We figured out who they pitched and started doing the same. It was a lot of work but free :)\n\nOur scrappy efforts made a big difference early on.\n\n**What I wish I knew**\n\nGoing from zero to your first real traction is brutal. You’re not sure if anything is working. You second guess everything. Once we found the right channel and leaned into it, things started to click. But that first stretch was by far the hardest.\n\nIf I had to do it again, I would have picked a better name and focused more on brand from day one. A good free version helps people talk about your product. We gated a lot early on because we were bootstrapped, but that made word of mouth harder.\n\n**Final thought**\n\nIf you're somewhere in that early stage still figuring things out, making slow progress, just know that it's supposed to feel that way. Your first $1M is not easy. But you learn so much. Focus on what's working and keep going!",

Multi-device workflows are table stakes for devs, and if you&#x27;re going to pull something that disruptive, you&#x27;d at least expect a changelog entry or smth.<p>Nope.<p>And just as people started comparing notes and figuring out that the story didn’t quite add up… the main Reddit thread got locked. Then deleted. Like, no public resolution, no real response, just silence.<p>To be clear: this wasn’t an actual policy change, just a backend session bug, and a hallucinated excuse from a support bot that somehow did more damage than the bug itself.<p>But at that point, it didn’t matter. People were already gone.<p>Honestly one of the most surreal product screwups I’ve seen in a while. Not because they made a mistake, but because the AI support system invented a lie, and nobody caught it until the userbase imploded.",

No LLM, no LSP, heck not even autocompletion. But damn proud of every hand crafted, easy to maintain and fully understood line of code I&#x27;ll write.",

The platform could also offer personalized advice and resources based on the founder's specific needs and goals.",

The tool could also provide real-time feedback and coaching to improve sales performance.",

The app could be built upon the Unsure Calculator concept and expanded to include features like scenario planning and sensitivity analysis."
