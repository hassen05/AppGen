      "selftext": "For years I couldn't figure out why it was so hard for me to go on vacation or take a break and \"forget about my startup\".  \n\nI would try, but every time I did I wound up being even more anxious than when I started.  I'd get 2 days into a week-long vacation, and I'd be sitting by the pool trying to wind down, but all my brain could do was think about what I had to do with my startup.\n\nSo a couple of years ago, I tried something different - I looked for a challenge that I could obsess over that was WAY bigger than my startup - and that's when it finally clicked.\n\nI'm an avid hobbyist carpenter, so I decided to design and build a new house entirely on my own.  I would learn everything from 3D modeling to create it to all of the trades necessary to build it.  I made this thing so overwhelming that I had no choice but to consume my brain.\n\n(BTW you can learn literally anything on YouTube!)\n\nNow, truth be told, I wasn't able to build every single aspect myself since there were certain things (like laying foundation or structural steel) the I wasn't looking to take chances with.  But I've designed every. single. aspect of this house in full 3D (Sketchup, Enscape, Vray) down to the size of the drawer slide in the basement bathroom.  I've built every kitchen cabinet, vanity, closet - you name it.  \n\nBut this isn't me talking about my carpentry skills; it's about talking about what it DID for me.  \n\nIt completely changed my focus.  Not in a way where it hurt my startup, but in a way it HELPED my startup (and me personally, which I think should count for something).\n\nI needed something that could compete with those anxious thoughts at 2am where I would normally be trying to solve my startup problems that frankly never got solved at 2am.  Instead my mind was consumed by SOLVABLE problems like how to best join two parts of a cabinet.  I had no idea how badly my mind needed to work on things that had a definitive start and end (this isn't a small point, many of us having timelines that are years, decades).\n\nI'm curious if anyone here has had a similar experience of how they've found a challenging counterbalance to their startup.  Yes, I'm also a father of two, so I'm well aware of how family fits here, I'm talking about outside of that.\n\n(I will not promote)",

This did not help as my mind was still in work 24/7 I just worked on different part of it with same obsessive passion.\n\nYear and a half ago my old game of choice, quake 2, got remastered and the community of old players resurfaced. This gave me option and push to try something I always wanted to do, make new maps.\n\nI found discord and people that helped me start, and there I was, obsessed by my new old passion. It helped me relax, moved my thoughts away from startup and business meetings.\n\nDid it help both? Well I for sure am better as I refocused to me, family and what I love. For the startup I think it also gave space to others to step where my obsession moved away.\n\nHope we both get the best out of this life.\nThanks for sharing OP.",

Don‚Äôt make the good ones run away after¬†drowning in messages from those just starting out and begging for introductions to the investors.¬†",
        "We ran a 650 member Discord for startup founders and execs (2018-2022). It was great for support (early on) and off-platform meetups, but there were key challenges with engagement and scaling trust once the group got big.\n\n*Early Decisions (and challenges):*\n\n* Vetting\n* Guardrails\n* Legal risks\n* Discord vs Slack\n\n*What worked well:*\n\n* Off platform events - A lot of members hosted events - basketball, coffee meetups, co-working, etc. That created real bonds that carried back online.\n* Promo sharing - Discount codes for tools (Docusign, Workspace, Domain sites, etc.) were a hit and created a karma effect.\n* Office & equipment sharing - Members would lend short-term access to things like office desks, 3D printers, camera gear, etc. Office space they charged way lower than commercial options and for gear they usually just charged for things they used like filaments (for 3D printing). One cooler example: a few members went in together on a professional embroidery machine to make custom marketing hats and shirts. They broke even compared to getting them done professionally. Others in the group could use it too. All they had to do was bring their own thread and chip in a small donation.\n\n*What didn't work:*\n\n* Heavy mod dependence - For the first 9 months, the group required active mods to seed conversations, follow-ups, and maintain engagement. It helped that one mod was a semi-well known entrepreneur with multiple exits, so people wanted to hear what he had to say and give feedback.\n* Too many channels - We created too many which resulted in empty channels. This made people think the entire server was a ghost town. We trimmed them down to just a few core ones and only added new ones when there was consistent demand. I'd suggest start with like 3-5 channels.\n* Group got too big (after 100) - Once we crossed 100 members, engagement dropped noticeably. People shared less because they didn't feel safe sharing with so many newer faces. Over time, small cliques formed and it started to feel like high school all over again.\n* Member expectations - These communities thrive when new members show up ready to contribute. It signals to others that there's mutual value. But in reality, we found most people wanted to consume rather than contribute. Many wanted to feel like part of a community, but without actually engaging. By the end, over 92% of members were lurkers (we had bots tracking user activity). While they logged in regularly, they didn't meaningfully participate or add value to the group.",
        "Yes. I run StartupSauce, a private slack community for advanced SaaS founders based outside Silicon Valley. \n\nSome advice:\n\n1 - Screen people before they are allowed to join. \n\nWe only allow founders and CEOs of SaaS businesses with $5k MRR or more to join. \n\nWe don‚Äôt take idea stage folks. We don‚Äôt take non-founders. We don‚Äôt accept people who run non-SaaS businesses. \n\nThis keeps the group relevant and ensures discussion is on point. It also filters out a lot of bad advice. \n\n2 - Have a regular ritual that brings people together. \n\nWe organise bi-weekly mastermind calls where founders can discuss problems and give each other advice. Technically they could just do this via the slack group - but there‚Äôs something a lot more human about a video call. Many of our members rarely post, but engage a lot on these calls. We also generally see a flurry of activity after these calls as it brings people back to our slack group and they catch up on all the other messages.\n\n3 - Don‚Äôt poke people for fake engagement \n\nThis was a crucial lesson for us. The conventional wisdom is to push people constantly to engage on slack. But our members are founders, they‚Äôre busy building their company and don‚Äôt want to sift through a thousand irrelevant messages to find one gold nugget. \n\nSo we focus on more signal, less noise. If we find something genuinely great, we‚Äôll post it. If someone asks for help, we‚Äôll offer resources and intros and tag other members with relevant experience. But we don‚Äôt just post shit for the sake of it - that‚Äôs just an annoying distraction for our members and we want to focus on quality. \n\n4 - Make sure there is a place to celebrate wins\n\nAs entrepreneurs, we spend a lot of time fighting fires and dealing with problems, so it‚Äôs nice to actually take some time out to be proud of what we built. \n\nAt StartupSauce we do this two ways. First we have a #wins channel where folks can post anything they consider a win. This isn‚Äôt necessary revenue - we‚Äôve had people post about finally finding that awesome developer they‚Äôve been trying to hire for months; or getting a kickass testimonial from a happy customer, to being able to fire their last consulting client and go all-in on their bootstrapped software business. These posts usually get a LOT of positive encouragement from other founders - and it feels really damn good to have a whole slack community of other founders cheering for you. \n\nThe other way? We have an unofficial tradition that when a member reaches $1m ARE we send them a gift - usually a bottle of wine or whiskey or something. I even bought some really fancy sparkling wine for a founder who didn‚Äôt drink. This is a huge milestone and it‚Äôs important to celebrate it. About 30% of our members are at $1m ARR or beyond so we‚Äôve actually had to buy a lot of gifts üòÇ. \n\n5 - Make sure there are some formal learning opportunities\n\nWe do workshops once a month. Usually they are member-led. Sometimes we record them, but sometimes - if the subject matter is really sensitive - we don‚Äôt. We have a big library of previous workshops that new members can watch. Everything from how to actually run FB ads for SaaS to building competitor comparison pages for SEO to selling your business and managing stress and burnout as a founder. \n\nWe ALSO require all our members to - at some stage - run a workshop or be on a panel discussion. So there is a formal mechanism for each member to share their knowledge with the community. This is super valuable, because it‚Äôs very rare that an earlier stage founder can get easy access to insights from so many other founders who are a few steps ahead. \n\nThere‚Äôs a LOT more to this, happy to discuss further privately if you want to DM me. \n\nWe made a bunch of mistakes too, like not having a content layer when we started, so I eventually bit the bullet and started a podcast where I interview 7 figure SaaS founders - but that wasn‚Äôt until several years into running the community.",
        "I run our Slack community of founders at [Startups.com](http://Startups.com) that currently has 1,300+ members (not all active). The biggest thing is to make sure your channels are organized (with proper permissions) in a sensible fashion and you have people dedicated to getting the flywheel spinning. In other words, nobody likes being part of a Slack where nobody talks (too much talking is a whole other thing). I find that founders on Slack act differently than discord users. So, listen to your audience and keep adjusting until you find your culture.",
        "From the other side ‚Äî each of my VCs has a group, and I‚Äôm in three different Techstars groups. There are thousands of founders between them, but fewer than 10 founder posts total each month. Most of the posts are just people sharing their LinkedIn content asking for likes and shares. These rarely get any engagement in Slack, but a lot of founders engage with the actual LinkedIn post ‚Äî so people are reading.\n\nI‚Äôm also in a local startup studio group, which is the most active. I think it‚Äôs the most active bc they have someone on staff who always posts in there forcing engagement.\n\nThe most active Slack groups I‚Äôm in are highly focused ‚Äî like GTM for [X eg Heath tech SaaS] or JS devs. They have way fewer people, but dozens of posts every day.\n\nI think the problem with general startup groups is that, yeah, we‚Äôre all founders ‚Äî but that‚Äôs where the similarities end. We‚Äôre building totally different companies, at different stages, and we‚Äôre all overworked. The advice ends up being general, not pointed like in niche GTM or dev groups. I think segmenting founders into verticals could help like marketplaces, health tech, etc. \n\nThis would give me a specific place to post a specific question and I would get a response from someone else doing that exact thing‚Ä¶. Kinda like subreddits but more private."

      "selftext": "There‚Äôs this false sense of stability that creeps in when things are going well. Clients are happy, work is flowing, and there‚Äôs always that one person on your team who just... gets it. They manage the chaos. They catch the things you miss. They‚Äôre your safety net, even if you don‚Äôt realize it.\n\nI had that person.\n\nWe used to joke that they had the whole agency mapped out in their head. Timelines, deliverables, tricky clients, feedback loops-they managed it all. I could sleep easy knowing they were on top of things. It felt like we were finally at that stage where things were smooth. Predictable, even.\n\nI remember finishing a Friday knowing everything was handled. That kind of peace in business is rare-and addictive.\n\nThen one morning, I got a message that knocked the wind out of me: \"Hey, can we chat for five minutes?\"\n\nThat five-minute chat changed everything.\n\nThey were leaving. No drama, no issues. Just moving on to something that made sense for them. But for me, it felt like a giant hole just opened up under our feet.\n\nThe days that followed were rough. The kind of rough you only understand when you‚Äôve built a business too tightly around specific people instead of strong systems. Tasks were missed. Clients followed up asking things I didn‚Äôt have answers to. Team members were unsure who was handling what. Everything felt... fragile.\n\nI realized, painfully, that we had built a business on memory, not method. Talent, not structure. And I‚Äôm not knocking talent. I just finally saw how risky it is when it‚Äôs the only thing holding things together.\n\nSo I did what most of us avoid until we‚Äôre forced to. I paused, and rebuilt.\n\nIt started small. A single Notion page. One checklist. Then another. I sat down with the team and said, ‚ÄúIf you do something more than once, we need it documented.‚Äù\n\nWe didn‚Äôt aim for perfection. Just clarity.\n\nThere was some hesitation at first. No one wants to stop and write things down when work is piling up. But a few weeks in, it clicked. We were moving faster. Fewer questions, fewer dropped balls. Everyone could see the difference.\n\nWe created a living playbook. No bloated manuals. No outdated PDFs. Real steps, written by the people who actually do the work. Every week, we‚Äôd update it. Improve it. Turn chaos into clarity.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt glamorous. But over time, it changed everything.\n\nNow, when someone joins the team, they get the keys to our system. They don‚Äôt guess. They follow. And they grow. If someone needs time off or moves on, the work doesn‚Äôt stop. The process doesn‚Äôt break.\n\nNotion, surprisingly, became the backbone of our business. A simple tool we underestimated turned into the foundation for consistency and growth.\n\nIf we were to hire someone new today, what used to take three weeks of handholding would now take just a few days. They‚Äôd step in, follow the process, and the system would do most of the heavy lifting. That‚Äôs how I know this is finally working.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing I wish someone had told me sooner:\n\nIf your business can‚Äôt run without one specific person, it‚Äôs not a business. It‚Äôs a dependency.\n\nProcesses aren‚Äôt the enemy of creativity. They protect it. They free your team to focus on better work, not just trying to remember what the next step is.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre running a service business, I‚Äôd challenge you to ask yourself:\n\n* What happens if your most reliable person takes two weeks off tomorrow?\n* Would the rest of your team know what to do?\n* Would your clients notice a difference?\n\nIf that question makes you uncomfortable, good. That‚Äôs where the work starts.\n\nStart with one thing. One recurring task. Write it down. Make it better each time. Tools like Notion or even a shared doc can take you a long way. Just don‚Äôt wait for the panic moment to make the shift.\n\nWe‚Äôre still improving. Still figuring things out. But we‚Äôre no longer scared of growing. And that feels like real progress.\n\nIf you‚Äôve been through a similar moment or are in the middle of one, I‚Äôd love to hear how you approached it. What worked, what didn‚Äôt, what you learned along the way.\n\nAnd if you haven‚Äôt hit that wall yet, maybe this story helps you avoid it.\n\nIf you're thinking about building your own SOP system and don‚Äôt know where to start, feel free to reach out. Always happy to help someone get unstuck.\n\n**A Simple SOP Template You Can Steal and Use Today:**\n\n**Title:** \\[Name of the task or process\\]\n\n**Purpose:** Briefly explain why this SOP exists and what outcome it supports.\n\n**Frequency:** How often is this task done (daily, weekly, monthly, ad hoc)?\n\n**Responsible:** Who is in charge of executing it?\n\n**Tools Needed:** List any apps, platforms, or tools required\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. Step one (what exactly needs to be done)\n2. Step two (details and specific instructions)\n3. Step three (add context or edge cases if necessary)\n\n**Checklist (Optional):**\n\n\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to start with everything. Just start with what‚Äôs repeating and painful. That‚Äôs usually the best place to begin.\n\n  \nHope this helped you :)",

Other firms follow.\n\nA startup will fail because a dominant agent misinterprets its product.\n\nThe new MVP = a prompt, a workflow, and a landing page.\n\nHiring an agent becomes the default for repetitive work.\n\nSMBs will be valued based on how easy they are to automate.\n\nNations enforce ‚Äúdigital protectionism‚Äù‚Äîblocking foreign agents.\n\nJailbroken GPT-9s hit the black market‚Äî$50k for unrestricted models.\n\nA new distribution hack emerges: get inside agent workflows.\n\nAI diagnoses 97% of conditions via smartphone pics; average doctors hit 62%.\n\nA small town becomes fully agent-run.

        "See my other comment about vibe coding before dumping too much time into this path.\n\nVibe coding is very new and over hyped right now. The reality of vibe coding is much different than what people will tell you. Vibe coding and AI is a whole have been going through so many huge changes so quickly that there is a very good chance that vibe coding will change quickly into something else or the next be AI thing will takeover.\n\nDespite the fear mongering both designers and developers are still needed and not obsolete. I'm not saying you shouldn't learn new skills. Personally I think everyone should know how LLMs work and how to properly prompt LLMs to prevent hallucination. Right now everyone thinks everything that AI does is perfect but it's far far from perfect. That's what I mean by over hyped. \n\nIf you are a good designer you could find clients to design for. Good designers are not going anywhere yet. \n\nIf I were you I would create a small agency, focus on designing specific types of websites and focus on getting premium customers that pay well. Create yourself a badass site with some a good handful of examples of your work. If you don't have any then make some. Do some research in the niche area you decide to design for and research what kind of customers are in your niche. This is an area where AI can be leveraged, help you research customers, competition, or even help you choose what niche to focus on.\n\nAnother idea is to create designs for websites, again you could focus on niche sites to help narrow the market and raise the price if you like, and use AI to create a frontend template that uses your designs and sell access/license to use your template marketplaces. I know of many people who aren't even top Sellers that make great passive revenue doing this and despite AI they are still in demand. \n\nThere's still a lot you can do with your design skills. I wouldn't give up on it. Also remember that just because the headlines make it sound like AI has already taken everything it doesn't mean it is true. Most big companies are struggling to figure out how to properly implement AI in a controllable way that doesn't introduce risk. Even Apple couldn't get AI to properly summarize the headlines of their articles without hallucinating and had to roll back. AI and these tools are for first adopters right now."

HOTP&#x2F;TOTP has a registration step, where you copy a server-generated secret to your phone through a QR-code-encoded otpauth:&#x2F;&#x2F; URI (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;google-authenticator&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Key-Uri-Format\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;google&#x2F;google-authenticator&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Key-Uri-...</a>). That doesn&#x27;t happen in a &quot;forgot password&quot; flow.<p>Incidentally, if you think of TOTP as being HMAC(unix mod 30, secret), one idea would be to do public key crypto instead of symmetric HMAC stuff. That&#x27;s basically what a security key is.<p>If you additionally made it so that you couldn&#x27;t phish the security key -- by having the OS + web browser know which apps can ask for which security keys -- you&#x27;d have reinvented WebAuthn.<p>P.S.: Make you sure you have stuffing protection in place against these kinds of six-digit-code auth schemes. A million possibilities is often acceptable for a secondary factor, but it&#x27;s useless if attackers can just try all million codes.<p>Since they&#x27;re in the thread, nice article &#x27;dogacel!

It seems to be able to piece together several tools to reach the desired goal and follows a roughly coherent plan.<p>- There is still more work to do here. Despite OpenAI&#x27;s cookbook[0] and some prompt engineering on my side, GPT-4.1 stops quickly to ask questions, getting into a quite useless &quot;convo mode&quot;. Its tool calls fails way too often as well in my opinion.<p>- It&#x27;s also able to handle significantly less complexity than Claude, resulting in some comical failures. Where Claude would create server endpoints, frontend components and routes and connect the two, GPT-4.1 creates simplistic UI that calls a mock API despite explicit instructions. When prompted to fix it, it went haywire and couldn&#x27;t handle the multiple scopes involved in that test app.<p>- With that said, within all these parameters, it&#x27;s much less unnerving than Claude and it sticks to the request, as long as the request is not too complex.<p>My conclusion: I like it, and totally see where it shines, narrow targeted work, adding to Claude 3.7 - for creative work, and Gemini 2.5 Pro for deep complex tasks. GPT-4.1 does feel like a smaller model compared to these last two, but maybe I just need to use it for longer.<p>0: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cookbook.openai.com&#x2F;examples&#x2F;gpt4-1_prompting_guide\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cookbook.openai.com&#x2F;examples&#x2F;gpt4-1_prompting_guide</a>"

And that&#x27;s, I think, why you cannot compete.\nI decided to quit Whatsapp, which in Latinamerica is quite an outrageous move: that application is the communication channel for EVERYTHING: all families, all schools, all neighborhoods. I did it because I think Meta&#x27;s main metric is actually hostile to their users: they want as much of your time as they can get from you, and they&#x27;ll use are sorts of psychological weaponry to keep you inside. They were actually vocal about it in the past. There&#x27;s zero reason to trust them. But why is it that no one has come up with a true alternative (although props to Signal)?
